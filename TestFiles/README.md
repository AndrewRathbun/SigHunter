# Contributing Test Files

## Contributing Tampered Files

Please name your files appropriately, i.e., if you're submitting a PNG that has been renamed to PPTX for the purpose of tool validation and testing, please name it something like `PNGRenamedToPPTX.pptx`, for instance. The filename should leave no question as to what was done to the file for the purpose of tool testing and validation.

## Contributing Untampered Files

If you're submitting a PNG, please make sure it's actually a PNG file. Filename doesn't matter for these files, at this time.
